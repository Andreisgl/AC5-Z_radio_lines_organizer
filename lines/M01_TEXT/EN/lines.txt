Galm 2 to Galm 1.|I'll leave the orders to you.|Give us a good show.
One of the bombers is leaving the front.
IFF malfunctioning. Withdrawing.
Understood.
Base Command to Galm Team.|Enemy assault force interception successful.
Cipher, I got a feeling you and me|are gonna get along just fine.
Buddy.
I hope they're careful with the bombs|when they hit the ground.
Galm Team, shoot down all enemy bombers.|Don't let them get to our base.
Galm 2, follow all orders from Galm 1.|Free engagement is prohibited during|this operation.
Roger. Awaiting your orders, Cipher.|You're Galm 1 now.
One of the bombers has left the battlefront.|He must've chickened out.
Why would he leave after getting this far?
This is Otto 5. IFF is out of commission.|Unable to carry out duty. Withdrawing|from operation airspace.
Low-life mercenaries!|Only you would be so cowardly to shoot down|a plane that's out of commission!
Enemy bombers have reached|the center of operation airspace.
Enemy bombers are advancing through|operation airspace. If they reach|our base, it's all over.

One enemy bomber down.|Continue with operation.
Nice shot, Galm 1.
One enemy down.

That's what I get paid for.|Now for the next one.
Third enemy bomber down.
There's only one left.
Base Command to Galm Team.|The enemy attack unit has been|successfully intercepted.
Let's get back to base.|Home sweet home.
Otto 5 to all planes.|I've completely withdrawn|from operational airspace.
Base Command.|I mopped up those escort planes.|Continuing on to enemy bombers.
Roger. We're counting on you.
Cipher, I've heard stories about you.|People say you never let your prey get away.
Cipher, I've heard stories about you.|They say you've got what it takes to win.
Cipher, I've heard stories about you.|That pride's gonna get you killed, you know.
Let's mop 'em up quick|and go out for a little hot rum?
Let's make quick work of these suckers|and treat ourselves to a little hot whiskey.
Let's get this job over with|and suck up a little hot wine.
Base Command to Galm Team.|The enemy attack unit has been|successfully intercepted.
Looks like they underestimated Valais Base.|I'm sure the Belkans realize that by now, too.
Base Command to Galm Team.|The enemy attack unit has been|successfully intercepted.
All planes, job well done!|You'll be paid well for this.
Base Command to Galm Team.|The enemy attack unit has been|successfully intercepted.
I'd like to see how those Belkan cowards|report back to their superiors.
(mute)
It's snowing hard out here.|Keep a close eye on your gauges.
All units, double-check your systems.
Feels like the control stick's about to ice over.
Head back to base if your plane has any problems.
No problems here.
If you want to turn back, now's the time.
I've gotta make some money today.
All those too scared to fly should go back|to base and wait patiently with their tail|between their legs.
Today's ace has to buy drinks when we get back.|And we're going to swig the night away.
Progressing steadily toward the operation target.
All units prepare to engage.
Don't die out there.|You still owe me money from poker.
Shut up and stay alert.|I don't want you hitting any snow peaks.
I won't be dying just yet!
Taking these guys out ought|to pretty up my kill score.
That's enough babbling.
Looks like they wanna finish us off.
That bomber looks ancient.
I'm gonna come out on top today.
They're only Belkans,|nothing to get too nervous about!
I'm gonna earn every penny of that money today.
Looks like Galm 2 is gonna steal the show again.
Come on, Pixy! Leave a few for us, will ya?
I don't have time for that.|It's every man for himself.
No one will find us if we crash out here.
Hurry up and shoot down the enemy|if you want to get back to base.
I'd hate to bail out in this snowstorm.
Don't get too greedy now. Just stay focused.
Why should I let you have all the fun?
Nobody better get shot down.|It's always a drag looking for casualties.
Solo Wing, think you can get back to base|in one piece today?

Looks like we're more than they bargained for.
I didn't think Ustio still had|this caliber of a squadron left.
Nothing was said about this in|the mission briefing. Seems like they|have a quality pilot within them.
We underestimated them.
Don't worry about it! Just keep flying straight!
Have faith in our escort planes.
Maintain current formation!
Stay on course.|Don't make things difficult for our escort planes.
Stay on course until our mission is accomplished.|Keep firing.
Leave the fighters to me.
They'll talk about us for years|if we can take all these guys out.
Take your pick and shoot 'em down.
They're staying in formation.|These guys are good.
Escort planes, back us up.|We don't want any fighters on our tails.
Never thought Ustios would be hiding out|in a place like this.
This is their last stronghold. Pitiful, isn't it?
It's all over for the Ustios.
Those escort planes are well trained.|They're not taking the bait.
Soon we won't have any place to go back to.
They don't plan to leave until|they've bombed the place.
Don't let them take out our bomber.
Just hold them off a little longer.
Cover it closely until the bombing is complete.
Those escort planes are in my way.|Somebody take them out for me!
Once we get through this,|the base is straight ahead.|We've gotta stop them.
I'm on the bomber's tail.|Take care of those escort planes for me!
Don't get too reckless.|Those escort plans will pick you off.
Don't let them pass this point.|We've gotta shoot down all the planes here.
No need to rush.|Just take 'em out one at a time.
