# AC5-Z_radio_lines_organizer
With dubbing and whatnot in mind, this script seeks to facilitate the process of organizing radio files from Ace Combat Zero/5

## CONCEPT
After importing tracks extracted from the game with the "bgm_pac_ace" tool, the script will go through the tracks, reproduce the using MFAudio, and prompt the user to fill out information about them, according to some indexing criteria. They are as follow:

### INDEXING_CRITERIA 
    'CHARACTER' - Who speaks the line
    'MISSION_NUMBER' - In what mission it appears
    'ACE_STYLE' - In what ace style it appears
    'TEXT' - What is said in the track


## SETUP:
When obtaining the scripts, make sure to source them from the "Releases' tab. It will contain the "MFAudio.exe" executable, which is necessary for audio playback.

## USAGE:
### PROJECTS:
The program separates its files into projects. Since indexing projects are expected to take longer than a simple unpacking, you can work on many indexing projects in paralel without worries.

When running the script, you will be prompted to choose which project to open, or to create one. When running the script for the first time, creating a new project will be the only option.
